Within this research topic, we investigate alpha and beta diversity patterns at both local and regional scales to disentangle the importance of local environmental variables, hydrological disturbances, biotic interactions, landscape features and dispersal in structuring freshwater communities. 

We are also particularly interested in understanding the importance of environmental selection, dispersal and ecological drift in shaping community organization in dendritic networks.
