Within this research topic, we investigate alpha and beta diversity patterns at both local and regional scales to disentangle the importance of local environmental variables (e.g. [Petsch et al. 2017](https://streamteam-furg.netlify.app/publication/2017-petsch/); [Castro et al. 2019](https://streamteam-furg.netlify.app/publication/2019-castro/)), hydrological disturbances ( [Schneck & Melo 2012](https://streamteam-furg.netlify.app/publication/2012-schneck/); [Schneck et al. 2017](https://streamteam-furg.netlify.app/publication/2017-schneck/)), biotic interactions ( [Schneck et al. 2013](https://streamteam-furg.netlify.app/publication/2013-schneck/); **more coming soon!**), landscape features ( [Costa et al. 2020](https://streamteam-furg.netlify.app/publication/2020-costa/)) and dispersal ( [Trindade et al. 2018](https://streamteam-furg.netlify.app/publication/2018-trindade/)) in structuring freshwater communities. 

We are also particularly interested in understanding the importance of environmental selection, dispersal and ecological drift in shaping community organization in dendritic networks.
