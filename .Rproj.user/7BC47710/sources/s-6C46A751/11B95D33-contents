I’m a Professor of Ecology at Instituto de Ciências Biológicas (Biological Sciences Institute) in Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande, [southernmost Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/@-17.1615981,-49.927824,5863354m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=pt-BR&authuser=0). 

I’m interested in freshwater ecology since I was an undergrad back in 2001. At that time, I started to work at the Limnology Lab at [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/), where I also did my Masters on the effects of eutrophication on stream benthic diatoms. 

During my [PhD in Ecology at UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/ppgecologia/) I worked with [Adriano S. Melo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adriano_Melo2) looking at the effects of habitat complexity, hydrological disturbances and grazers on structuring stream benthic algal communities. 

Nowadays I continue working with freshwater ecology investigating biodiversity patterns and underlying mechanisms and supervising a talented group of young Brazilian scientists.
