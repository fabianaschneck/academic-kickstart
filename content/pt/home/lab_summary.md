<font size="4"><span style="color:#607CA0">**We have a special bond with streams**</span>, and at most of our studies we use benthic diatoms as a biological model to describe diversity patterns and test ecological hypotheses. Our studies also encompass stream insects, phytoplankton and macrophytes in lentic environments and mesocosm experiments.</font>
