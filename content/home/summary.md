We are mostly interested in better understanding **spatial and temporal patterns of freshwater biodiversity** and underlying mechanisms, especially in **streams**. Particularly, the study of **beta diversity** may offer insights on the factors driving biodiversity patterns.

Streams harbor a large portion of freshwater biodiversity, but are being highly modified by human-induced impacts at both local and landscape scales. In southern Brazil, those impacts are mainly related to the **replacement of natural landscapes by agricultural ones**. Thus, it becomes a pressing task to understand how **stream communities respond to anthropogenic changes**.
